# Sentiment Analysis in newspapers after the Peruvian presidential speech July 2021
This project was developed in team as a final assignment in a Natural Language Processing course. We did web scraping in 5 different Peruvian newspapers editors in order to building our dataset, then prepared the data with SpaCY and ran a Naive Bayes model trained with the sentiment-analysis-spanish library. This is just a beginning there's just more analysis to do... sit and hold yourself!
